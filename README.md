Pimatic Plugin for [Johnny Five](http://johnny-five.io), a Robotics and IoT programming framework. 

![Logo](https://github.com/mwittig/pimatic-johnny-five/raw/master/assets/images/johnny-five-icon.png)

Thanks to Johnny Five, you can easily integrate a wide range of sensors and actuators attached to 
* an Arduino board, 
* an ESP8266 board, 
* a Photon board, or
* your Raspberry Pi. Generally, it is possible to use multiple boards at the same time which may be local boards, 
i.e. the host running pimatic or a board attached via USB to the pimatic host, or remote boards connected via LAN, 
WiFi or some proxy device on the local network.

For Arduino, the universal Firmata library is used which implements a protocol for the 
communication with host computer. Thus, there is no need to modify the Arduino sketch when new sensors or actuators 
are connected to your Arduino. Johnny Five also supports a variety of [I2C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C) and
[1-Wire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1-Wire) devices.

Support for ESP8266 is experimental at the moment as it requires the 
["esp" development branch](https://github.com/firmata/arduino/tree/esp) of Firmata. 

## Status of implementation

This version supports the following devices
* ContactSensor, PresenceSensor, and ButtonSensor (digital input)
* Dimmer (digital output with PWM)
* Switch (digital output)
* Relay Switch (relay boards attached to digital output)
* Temperature Sensor (analog, I2C and 1-Wire)
* Temperature & Humidity Sensor (analog, I2C - sorry, no 1-Wire support, to date)
* Temperature & Barometric Pressure Sensor (I2C devices such as BMP180, MPL115A2, MPL3115A2)

The OLED and LCD display devices are incomplete and, thus, should not be used.
They won't do anything useful anyway.

Board-support has been tested with "arduino", "raspi-io", "particle-io", "etherport" and "expander" board types.
Support for "etherport-client" and "esp8266" is experimental. 

## Getting Started

This section is still work in progress.

~~**Important Note**: Due to an [node-gyp issue with raspi-io](https://github.com/nebrius/raspi-io/issues/40) the package
will not build properly when installed as root which is the default when you install plugin via the mobile frontend. 
As a work-around, please open a shell, remove the package and install again using an unprivileged user.~~ (solved with pimatic@0.8.107)

### Platform Support

The plugin currently supports Arduino, Raspberry Pi boards, and tethering. More boards can be
added on request. The Johnny Five project provides a detailed
[list of supported platforms](https://johnny-five.io/platform-support/) with
detailed information on supported features and how to set up the board.

## Plugin Configuration

You can load the plugin by editing your `config.json` to include the following
in the `plugins` section. You need to configure the boards you wish to use to control
your devices. Generally, a board is a control system as part of pimatic to drive the
hardware board you use, for example,
* your Raspberry Pi,
* an Arduino board attached to your Raspberry Pi via USB,
* an I2C Expander chip connected to to your Raspberry Pi or Arduino, or
* a remote board connected via etherport.

The following configuration is an example for pimatic with an Arduino Nano
connected via USB on ttyUSB1 and an Expander connected to the Arduino:

    {
        "plugin": "johnny-five",
        "boards": [
        {
          "id": "1",
          "boardType": "arduino",
          "port": "/dev/ttyUSB1",
          "baudrate": 57600
        },
        {
          "id": "2",
          "boardType": "raspi-io"
        },
